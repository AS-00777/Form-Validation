# JavaScript Form Validation Project

## Description
Forms are an essential part of any website, and proper validation ensures that the submitted data is accurate and secure. This project focuses on implementing **form validation** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** without relying on external libraries.

The form includes the following required fields:
- **Full Name**
- **Email ID**
- **Phone Number**
- **Password**
- **Confirm Password**

## Validation Criteria
✅ Full Name must be at least **5 characters** long  
✅ Email ID must contain the `@` character  
✅ Phone Number must be a **10-digit number** and **not** be `1234567890`  
✅ Password must be at least **8 characters** long and **must not** be `password` or the user's name  
✅ Password and Confirm Password must match  
✅ Real-time validation messages should appear if criteria are not met (e.g., *Enter a valid email*, *Password is too weak*, etc.)  
✅ Additional validation rules can be added for enhanced security  

## Features
✔️ Uses **event listeners** (`onSubmit`, `onChange`) for validation  
✔️ Implements **JavaScript functions, loops, and conditional statements (if/else)**  
✔️ Provides **real-time feedback** with error messages  
✔️ Styled using **CSS (Flexbox/Grid) & Bootstrap** for a modern look  
✔️ **No external libraries** used; built using **vanilla JavaScript**  
✔️ Fully deployed and accessible via **Netlify**
